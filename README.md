A scalar value is interpreted as FALSE in the Boolean sense if it is
    undefined, the null string or the number 0 (or its string equivalent,
    "0"), and TRUE if it is anything else. The Boolean context is just a
    special kind of scalar context where no conversion to a string or a number
    is ever performed.
